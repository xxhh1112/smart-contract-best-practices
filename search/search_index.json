When it tries to refund the old leader, it reverts if the refund fails. This means that a malicious bidder can become the leader while making sure that any refunds to their address will always fail. In this way, they can prevent anyone else from calling the <code>bid()</code> function, and stay the leader forever. A recommendation is to set up a pull payment system instead, as described earlier.</p> <p>Another example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It's common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should revert. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete. No one gets paid because one address is forcing an error.</p> <pre><code>address[] private refundAddresses;\nmapping (address =&gt; uint) public refunds;\n\n// bad\nfunction refundAll() public {\n    for(uint x; x &lt; refundAddresses.length; x++) { // arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated\n        require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]])) // doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Again, the recommended solution is to favor pull over push payments.</p> <p>See SWC-113</p>"},{"location":"attacks/denial-of-service/#dos-with-block-gas-limit","title":"DoS with Block Gas Limit","text":"<p>Each block has an upper bound on the amount of gas that can be spent, and thus the amount computation that can be done. This is the Block Gas Limit. If the gas spent exceeds this limit, the transaction will fail. This leads to a couple of possible Denial of Service vectors:</p>"},{"location":"attacks/denial-of-service/#gas-limit-dos-on-a-contract-via-unbounded-operations","title":"Gas Limit DoS on a Contract via Unbounded Operations","text":"<p>You may have noticed another problem with the previous example: by paying out to everyone at once, you risk running into the block gas limit.</p> <p>This can lead to problems even in the absence of an intentional attack. However, it's especially bad if an attacker can manipulate the amount of gas needed. In the case of the previous example, the attacker could add a bunch of addresses, each of which needs to get a very small refund. The gas cost of refunding each of the attacker's addresses could, therefore, end up being more than the gas limit, blocking the refund transaction from happening at all.</p> <p>This is another reason to favor pull over push payments.</p> <p>If you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. You will need to keep track of how far you've gone, and be able to resume from that point, as in the following example:</p> <pre><code>struct Payee {\n    address addr;\n    uint256 value;\n}\n\nPayee[] payees;\nuint256 nextPayeeIndex;\n\nfunction payOut() {\n    uint256 i = nextPayeeIndex;\n    while (i &lt; payees.length &amp;&amp; gasleft() &gt; 200000) {\n      payees[i].addr.send(payees[i].value);\n      i++;\n    }\n    nextPayeeIndex = i;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You will need to make sure that nothing bad will happen if other transactions are processed while waiting for the next iteration of the <code>payOut()</code> function. So only use this pattern if absolutely necessary.</p>"},{"location":"attacks/denial-of-service/#gas-limit-dos-on-the-network-via-block-stuffing","title":"Gas Limit DoS on the Network via Block Stuffing","text":"<p>Even if your contract does not contain an unbounded loop, an attacker can prevent other transactions from being included in the blockchain for several blocks by placing computationally intensive transactions with a high enough gas price.</p> <p>To do this, the attacker can issue several transactions which will consume the entire gas limit, with a high enough gas price to be included as soon as the next block is mined. No gas price can guarantee inclusion in the block, but the higher the price is, the higher is the chance.</p> <p>If the attack succeeds, no other transactions will be included in the block. Sometimes, an attacker's goal is to block transactions to a specific contract prior to specific time.</p> <p>This attack was conducted on Fomo3D, a gambling app. The app was designed to reward the last address that purchased a \"key\". Each key purchase extended the timer, and the game ended once the timer went to 0. The attacker bought a key and then stuffed 13 blocks in a row until the timer was triggered and the payout was released. Transactions sent by attacker took 7.9 million gas on each block, so the gas limit allowed a few small \"send\" transactions (which take 21,000 gas each), but disallowed any calls to the <code>buyKey()</code> function (which costs 300,000+ gas).</p> <p>A Block Stuffing attack can be used on any contract requiring an action within a certain time period. However, as with any attack, it is only profitable when the expected reward exceeds its cost. The cost of this attack is directly proportional to the number of blocks which need to be stuffed. If a large payout can be obtained by preventing actions from other participants, your contract will likely be targeted by such an attack.</p> <p>See SWC-128</p>"},{"location":"attacks/deprecated/","title":"Deprecated/Historical","text":"<p>These are attacks which are no longer possible due to changes in the protocol or improvements to solidity.

This may or may not be relevant, depending on the implementation. Think about whether or not the <code>uint</code> value has an opportunity to approach such a large number. Think about how the <code>uint</code> variable changes state, and who has authority to make such changes. If any user can call functions which update the <code>uint</code> value, it's more vulnerable to attack. If only an admin has access to change the variable's state, you might be safe. If a user can increment by only 1 at a time, you are probably also safe because there is no feasible way to reach this limit.</p> <p>The same is true for underflow. If a uint is made to be less than zero, it will cause an underflow and get set to its maximum value.</p> <p>Be careful with the smaller data-types like uint8, uint16, uint24...etc: they can even more easily hit their maximum value.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Be aware there are around 20 cases for overflow and underflow.</p> <p>One simple solution to mitigate the common mistakes for overflow and underflow is to use <code>SafeMath.sol</code> library for arithmetic functions.

This resource provides in-depth articles to guide you in developing robust and secure smart contracts.</p> <p>Many applications require submitted data to be private up until some point in time in order to work. Games (eg. on-chain rock-paper-scissors) and auction mechanisms (eg. sealed-bid Vickrey auctions) are two major categories of examples. If you are building an application where privacy is an issue, make sure you avoid requiring users to publish information too early. The best strategy is to use commitment schemes with separate phases: first commit using the hash of the values and in a later phase revealing the values.</p> <p>However, care must be taken to ensure that the hashed value stored isn't recognisable (and thus, de-mappable), as this would defeat the second purpose of hashing - preventing the reveal of such values. Here's an example:</p> <p>Say a smart contract allows 2 players to play rock-paper-scissors, and uses this commit-reveal scheme - both players have to send a hash of their move before either of them sends the last (game ending) transaction. Here's what the keccak256 hash of <code>rock</code> is: <code>10977e4d68108d418408bc9310b60fc6d0a750c63ccef42cfb0ead23ab73d102</code>. If you were playing, and you saw your opponent commiting this, wouldn't this tell you exactly what move your opponent has committed to? A safer implementation would be to hash not just the name of the move, but also, say, a user chosen salt. That would make the resulting salt non-recognisable.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>In rock paper scissors, require both players to submit a hash of their intended move first, then   require both players to submit their move; if the submitted move does not match the hash throw it   out.</li> <li>In an auction, require players to submit a hash of their bid value in an initial phase (along   with a deposit greater than their bid value), and then submit their auction bid value in the   second phase.</li> <li>When developing an application that depends on a random number generator, the order should always   be (1) players submit moves, (2) random number generated, (3) players paid out. The method   by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class   solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through http://btcrelay.org),   hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to \"commit\" to   the value, and then reveals the value later) and RANDAO.
